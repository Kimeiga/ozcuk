Regardless of its direction, it can gather a hurricane-strength, thus it is a storm too."],"tags":["often"]},{"glosses":["a male given name"]}],"forms":[{"form":"borayı","tags":["accusative","definite"]},{"form":"boralar","tags":["plural"]}],"etymology":"Inherited from Ottoman Turkish بورا (bora, “squall, tempest”), possibly a derivation from Proto-Turkic *bora- (“north wind; to snow heavily”). Cognate with Crimean Tatar and Turkmen boran, Bashkir буран (buran), Kazakh боран (boran). Or a wanderword, compare Italian bora, ultimately from Latin borea and, Greek μπόρα (mpóra). The same root as bora is found in the name of the Greek mythological figure of Boreas (Βορέας). Scholars argue, the Serbo-Croatian name bura and Slovene burja are not etymologically related to bora; they derive from Common Slavic burja 'storm' (from the verb *burĭti), and the meaning 'bora' developed later."}
